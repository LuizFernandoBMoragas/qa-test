1.4 TEST CASES BASED ON A NEW USER STORY
    Instructions:
    1. Before development starts, outline any questions or concerns that need to be discussed
    with the Product Owner and/or the development team.

-------------------------------

- Where should the "Remove" button be placed relative to the item in the cart (Example: left, right, below the item details)?

- Should the button be styled consistently with other buttons in the cart, or should it have a distinct design (Example: color or icon)?

- Should there be a confirmation step before removing an item (Example: a popup saying "Are you sure you want to remove this item?")?

- Should we allow an "Undo" option after removing an item in case of accidental removal?

- Should the item count update immediately on the same page, or does it require a page reload?

- How will the total price be updated in the cart when an item is removed?

- What happens if the user removes all items from the cart? Should we display a "Cart is empty" message or redirect them elsewhere?

- How does the system handle removing an item when thereâ€™s a network delay or failure?

- Should we log "Remove" button clicks for analytics purposes to track user behavior?

- Are there any audit or logging requirements for tracking removed items?

- Is the "Remove" button accessible to users using screen readers or keyboard navigation?

- Is there a limit to how many items can be removed simultaneously?

- Are there any backend dependencies or external systems that need to be updated when an item is removed?

- What browsers and devices should be tested for this feature?
