Note: The second part of this task (1.5.2 from the QA test) was made together with the second question in the QA test (1.3). 
The third question of the QA test (1.3) is regarding an automated test to 'Add to cart' functionality (as per question 1.2) in one of the e-commerce aplications.
-In order to better use the time i had to completing the QA test, for this question (1.3), i used the same e-commerce and product page as per question 1.5. With this in mind, the automated test for ensuring the Add to Basket functionality already includes some of the most critical features for this product page.
